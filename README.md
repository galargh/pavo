# pavo

Pavo is an OSX framework written in Swift responsible for continuous and
efficient display capture.

### pavo
The framework was named after all the [Peafowls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peafowl)
and the wonderful 'display' they have.

### How to include the framework in a project?
1. Clone the Pavo repository
```
git clone https://github.com/gfjalar/pavo.git
```
2. Open the project in XCode and build it
3. In XCode, right click Pavo/Products/Pavo.framework and 'Show in Finder'
4. Drag & drop Pavo.framework in the project
5. Inside the project(General settings) add Pavo.framework to
'Embedded Binaries'

*I found [Haroon Baig's post](https://medium.com/@PyBaig/build-your-own-cocoa-touch-frameworks-in-swift-d4ea3d1f9ca3) very helpful when creating the framework*

### TODO:
* usage, examples, how it works
